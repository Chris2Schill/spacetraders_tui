  SpaceTraders API

  SpaceTraders is an open-universe game and learning platform that offers a set of HTTP endpoints to control a fleet of ships and explore a multiplayer universe.  The API is documented using [OpenAPI](https://github.com/SpaceTradersAPI/api-docs). You can send your first request right here in your browser to check the status of the game server.  ```json http {   \"method\": \"GET\",   \"url\": \"https://api.spacetraders.io/v2\", } ```  Unlike a traditional game, SpaceTraders does not have a first-party client or app to play the game. Instead, you can use the API to build your own client, write a script to automate your ships, or try an app built by the community.  We have a [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/jh6zurdWk5) where you can share your projects, ask questions, and get help from other players.
